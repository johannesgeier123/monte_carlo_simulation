# Monte Carlo Simulation

This project demonstrates a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the area under the standard normal distribution curve using random sampling.

## What It Does

- Simulates random points under a probability density function 
- Estimates the area under the curve by comparing hits under the function
- Compares the Monte Carlo result with the exact value  
- Plots the error (deviation) against number of trials to show convergence

## Key Features

- Configurable base (x-range), height (y-range), and number of trials
- Customizable function (`myFun`) to integrate
- Deviation plot for analyzing estimation accuracy as trial count increases
